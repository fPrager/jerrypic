JerryPic
---------

The JerryPic is an adoption of the OnlineSaver project from perterson. Like the 
original script, it is used to download automatically download an image from
an online source and use it as a screensaver image for the kindle.

The difference is, that it does a naiv check of timestamps to prevent unnecessary image downloads.

"OnlineScreensaver" by peterson

The code base is almost a complete copy of the KUAL-extension "Online Screensaver" that
is based on the "screensaver hack".
